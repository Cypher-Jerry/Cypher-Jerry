# MKSE revisit
*Different from Multi-User setting, Multi-Key is another setting brought up by Popa et al. in 2014, each user store their documents on a remote server, and they wish to share documents access with others.*

*A trivial solution is to re-encrypt each file user wants to share and send the key to others, which incurs heavy key management burden and searches could involve significant communication overhead.*

*The scheme Popa brought up failed to defend against one special type attack, which is malicious Bob sharing information with Alice and later collude with server to recover Alice's queries.*

## Hamlin 2018
Proposed:
1. Newly defined MKSE definition
2. Simple Construction using PRF only

Each document has its data key $K^d$, each user has their user key $K^u$. When sharing documents with other users, data owner together with data user compute and store $\Delta_{u,d}$ to server. when user submit queries using $K^u$, it is further transformed into a test key using $\Delta_{u,d}$. The test key can be used to test membership of queried keyword in shared document.

### Construction
**Setup:**
$$K^d,K^u\leftarrow{\lbrace0,1\rbrace^\lambda}$$

**Share:**
$$r\leftarrow{\lbrace0,1\rbrace^\lambda}\\
Decrypt\ D\ using\ K^d\ to\ obtain\ w_i\\
for\ each\ w_i\in D:\\
k_i=F_{K^u}(w_i),d_i=F_{K^i}(r) \\
adds\ d_i\ into\ D\\
insert\ D\ into\ hashtable\\
output\ \Delta_{u,d}=(r,D)

$$

**Search:**
$$
User\ outputs\ F_{K^u}(w_i)\ as\ q\\
Server\ computes\ F_q(r)\ and\ test\\
Whether\ exists\ in\ D\ or\ not
$$

## Discussion
- Search Method: In MKSE, shared documents are not updated to inverted index. Search is in fact done by membership test, whose search complexity is $O(n)$, refer $n$ as shared file number.
- Data Owner sends $K^d$ via secure channel when sharing, and user complete the share process. The random value r can be regarded as document-specific.
- So in fact such MKSE is another kind of re-encryption, malicious data owners have no information about $K^u$, so nothing can be leaked.

## Motivation
What confuses me most is the background setting: Sharing documents to others.

Receive and Encrypt seems to be a common operation and why do we need to design a scheme for it?
